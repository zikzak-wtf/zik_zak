# 🦖🛡️ ZIK_ZAK REVOLUTIONARY SECURITY DEMO 🛡️🦖
#
# This script demonstrates how ZIK_ZAK completely revolutionizes
# backend security with ACCOUNTING-BASED PERMISSIONS!
#
# 🔥 What we're destroying:
# - Complex SQL Row Level Security policies
# - Slow permission checks
# - Rigid security models
# - Complex audit trails
#
# 🚀 What we're building:
# - Instant permission checks (balance lookups)
# - Infinite flexibility
# - Automatic audit trails
# - Multi-tenant security
# - Dynamic permissions
